# Changelog

## v0.4.2

- feat: agent transcript export/import with mandatory project targeting on import. Export discovers `~/.cursor/projects/*/agent-transcripts/*.jsonl`, builds a public Gist with a manifest, and import maps each source project to a local project folder before writing.
- feat: commands `Cursor Sync: Export Agent Transcripts` and `Cursor Sync: Import Agent Transcripts` (see `cursorSync.transcripts.enabled`, default off; `cursorSync.transcripts.maxFileSizeKB`).

## v0.4.1

- feat: broaden default skills sync path from `skills/**/SKILL.md` to `skills/**` so all files under the skills directory are synced, not just SKILL.md files.

## v0.4.0

- feat: replace the TreeView sidebar with a Webview-based panel featuring a rich HTML/CSS interface that adapts to any VS Code theme.
- feat: add an always-visible status card at the top of the sidebar showing sync state, last sync time (relative), sync direction, and tracked file count.
- feat: add a history panel listing up to 50 past sync operations with direction, trigger type, file count, success/failure indicator, and relative timestamps.
- feat: add `Cursor Sync: Sync Now` command that automatically determines whether to push, pull, or both based on local and remote changes.
- feat: Sync Now is available as a sidebar button, a view title toolbar icon, and a Command Palette entry.
- feat: action grid in sidebar provides quick access to Push, Pull, Export, and Import.

## v0.3.2

- feat: scheduled auto-sync now performs pull-push instead of push-only. The scheduler fetches the remote Gist manifest and compares file checksums against local state to determine whether to pull, push, both, or skip.
- feat: `executePull` accepts a `trigger` option; scheduled pulls bypass safe mode confirmation.
- feat: sync is skipped when no changes are detected on either side, and conflicts on the same file block the scheduled sync with a logged warning.

## v0.3.1

- feat: add `cursorSync.syncExtensions.autoInstall` (default `true`) to automatically install extensions from the synced list on pull.
- feat: add `cursorSync.syncExtensions.autoUninstall` (default `false`) and optional confirmation to uninstall extensions that are not in the synced list on pull.

## v0.3.0

- feat: change `cursorSync.schedule.enabled` default to `true`.
- feat: add `Cursor Sync: Export Settings to Public Gist` command to selectively share settings via public Gists.
- feat: add `Cursor Sync: Import Settings from Public Gist` command to import settings from a public Gist URL or ID without requiring a GitHub token.

## v0.2.1

- feat: add `Cursor Sync: Reset Extension State` command to easily clear the GitHub token, sync state, and reset configuration to defaults.

## v0.2.0

- feat: anonymous usage metrics are collected to help improve the extension. No sensitive data (tokens, gist IDs, file paths, or error messages) is ever sent.

## v0.1.6

- feat: add sidebar view and status bar item for Cursor Sync.
- feat: add icons to push and pull commands.
- fix: remove `skills-cursor/**/SKILL.md` from default sync paths.

## v0.1.5

- docs: added changelogs for previous versions.

## v0.1.4

- chore: update package version to 0.1.4 in package.json.
- Save sync state when an existing Gist is found.

## v0.1.3

- feat: enhance Gist management and update package metadata.
- Find existing Gists in GistClient; pull and push use existing Gist when not configured.
- Package version set to 0.1.3; icon path added; assets/icon.png included; .vscodeignore updated for packaging.

## v0.1.1

- chore: update package metadata and add prepublish script.
- Publisher name set to Marcelo Barella; repository URL added in package.json.
- Prepublish script runs build before publishing.
- .cursor added to .gitignore.
